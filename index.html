				<h2 class="headers2"><b>INTRO</b></h2>
				<p>My approach to creating a drawing or painting usually revolves around observation. Sometimes I strive to capture the image exactly as I see it. In this scenario, I draw a series of variations, sometimes on the same sheet of paper, until I perfect the image. After this, I might add color to complete it. In other cases, I might try to focus less on a likeness and more on the general structure or feeling of a piece. This would also be based on observation, but I alter the image in front of me to create a more interesting composition or subject matter. In this way, my focus is not only on realism and detail but on the emotion or idea that the work might convey.
					<br>I am inspired to create a drawing when I see something that strikes me as beautiful or pleasing in some way. It is always a selfish decision, based on my personal reaction. Sometimes I notice light hitting an object in a particular way or a shape created by objects in front of me and I hastily capture it on paper before the moment passes and the beauty is gone. After I have a basic sketch, I often later develop it further to create a finished piece. Sometimes I am influenced by my interests. For example, natural objects or scenes have always been particularly inspiring to me. If I am unable to find anything of particular beauty around me, I pick something mundane at random. Once I begin to develop it, it quickly becomes interesting.
					<br>I was driven to draw The Village by my appreciation for the beauty of the sprawling cityscape of Manhattan. Creating The Visitor, I was influenced by the Expressionist idea of distortion and exaggeration. The domination of the nose in the frame seemed amusing to me at the time and let me see the face in an entirely different way. For Noodles, the three distinct layers of color around my brother (the boy depicted eating noodles) caught my attention and I wanted to incorporate them into a drawing. The Fauve concept of vibrant colors drove me to partially ignore the duller tones that I saw in favor of a brighter, more colorful piece. The distracted look of the boy as he consumes noodles characterizes my brother. Hydrangea and The Toad were both inspired simply by my sudden interest. For Hydrangea, the three-dimensionality that the uneven lighting gave the flower drew my attention. Similarly, for The Toad, I wanted to depict the shiny but bumpy texture of the toadâ€™s skin. I ended up developing both of these beyond just sketches and into finished pieces. For Self-Portrait in Red, I wanted to try only distinguishing light from dark in my face with different reddish tones to complete the effect of a figure of power looking down from above.
